# Activity: Python Function Practice Part 4
* In this activity we are going to practice writing functions in Python.
* The prompts have been listed below.
* Work must be completed using a local code editor, and should be pushed to GitHub.
* Be sure to submit the link to your GitHub repository on Canvas when you are finished.
* For each of the functions described below, plan the best way to write the function.
* Remember that there may be a recursive and an iterative solution to many problems.
* The best solution to any problem is the solution that you understand best.
* As long as your function is named correctly, accepts the correct parameters, and returns the correct output, you can be confident that you have succeeded at your task.
## Write the Following Functions
* Write a Python function called max_num()to find the maximum of three numbers.
* Write a Python function called mult_list() to multiply all the numbers in a list.
* Write a Python function called rev_string() to reverse a string.
* Write a Python function called pascal() that prints out the first n rows of Pascal's triangle.
* * The function accepts the number n, the number of rows to print
* * Note : Pascal's triangle is an arithmetic and geometric figure first imagined by Blaise Pascal.
* * * Each number is the two numbers above it added together.
* Sample Pascal's triangle :

| A | B | C | D | E |
|---|---|---|---|---|  
| 1 |   |   |   |   |
| 1v|v1 |   |   |   |
| 1 |^2^| 1 |   |   |
| 1 | 3 | 3v|v1 |   |
| 1 | 4 | 6 |^4^| 1 |

* Sample output:
~~~

def pascal():
	#your code here

pascal(1)
'''
output:
1
'''

pascal(5)
'''
output:
1
1 1
1 2 1
1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
'''
